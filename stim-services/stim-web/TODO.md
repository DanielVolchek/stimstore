# Todo

- Microservices/Emails
- Feature requests via kanban board

# Fix

- Empty user can register/create account (FIXED)
    - This could benefit from being changed further as at the moment the input validation happens very late down the line
    - Could benefit from being moved higher up in the api
- Pressing sorry this is already rented throws an error (FIXED)
